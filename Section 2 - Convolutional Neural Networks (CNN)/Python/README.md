# Artificial Neural Network

## Definition

An artificial neuron network (neural network) is a computational model that mimics the way nerve cells work in the human brain.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) use learning algorithms that can independently make adjustments - or learn, in a sense - as they receive new input. This makes them a very effective tool for non-linear statistical data modeling.

Deep learning ANNs play an important role in machine learning (ML) and support the broader field of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

An artificial neural network has three or more layers that are interconnected. The first layer consists of input neurons. Those neurons send data on to the deeper layers, which in turn will send the final output data to the last output layer.

All the inner layers are hidden and are formed by units which adaptively change the information received from layer to layer through a series of transformations. Each layer acts both as an input and output layer that allows the ANN to understand more complex objects. Collectively, these inner layers are called the neural layer.

The units in the neural layer try to learn about the information gathered by weighing it according to the ANNâ€™s internal system.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a dataset containing images of Dogs and Cats in large number.
We try to train our model by performing Deep learning using CNN to extract feature of images and adjust weights of neural network to prededict whether a image is of Dog or Cat

## Test Our Model

You can see our model by going to our Google Collab session run all cells to visualize the results.

Dataset of this model is very larged sized so we can not test in on collab. To test this model I created a program based on voice assistant which takes input in your voice that which file you want to test and then predicts whether that is cat or dog. I attached already trained data model with that program to test our model.
