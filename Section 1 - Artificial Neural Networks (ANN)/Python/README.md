# Artificial Neural Network

## Definition

An artificial neuron network (neural network) is a computational model that mimics the way nerve cells work in the human brain.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) use learning algorithms that can independently make adjustments - or learn, in a sense - as they receive new input. This makes them a very effective tool for non-linear statistical data modeling.

Deep learning ANNs play an important role in machine learning (ML) and support the broader field of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

An artificial neural network has three or more layers that are interconnected. The first layer consists of input neurons. Those neurons send data on to the deeper layers, which in turn will send the final output data to the last output layer.

All the inner layers are hidden and are formed by units which adaptively change the information received from layer to layer through a series of transformations. Each layer acts both as an input and output layer that allows the ANN to understand more complex objects. Collectively, these inner layers are called the neural layer.

The units in the neural layer try to learn about the information gathered by weighing it according to the ANNâ€™s internal system.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a real world dataset containing detail of different customers of a bank collected by bank management team. The data consist of many features about the customer as their income, balance, credit score etc.
We try to train our model by performing Deep learning using ANN to predict whether a particular customer stays in the bank or exits the bank and to target which type of customers.

## Test Our Model

You can test our model by going to our Google Collab session and upload attached dataset in that session and run all cells to visualize the results.

## Results 

On running the Model you will see simillar results as shown below with our given dataset. If you wish to upload your own dataset you can rename and restructure that dataset as ours and upload it to session to view results.
